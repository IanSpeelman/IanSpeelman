# üëã Hi, I'm Ian Speelman

I'm a self-learning web developer based in Tran√•s, J√∂nk√∂ping, Sweden. My passion for programming began years ago, and while I started studying it in school, I unfortunately didn't complete my education‚Äîa decision I've long regretted. Recently, after becoming jobless, I seized the opportunity to dive back into studying and refine my skills, particularly in web development.
